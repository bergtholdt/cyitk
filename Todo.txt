Todos:
- PixelType and ElementType should be treated appropriately in the ImportImageContainer related code (even though it currently works for scalar images)
- deal with vector, tensor and multi-channel images
- add CMake install rules
- allow distributing Cython-generated source files together with ITK code and a CMakeLists
- make Numpy an optional dependency

Bug:
- segmentation fault:
import cyitkTest as cyitk
image = cyitk.ReadImageS2('/Users/Luca/Work/Development/cyitk/Testing/cyitkGaussianSmoothingTest/input.nrrd')
image.GetArray()
  but no segfault with:
import cyitkTest as cyitk
image = cyitk.ImageS2()
image.GetArray()
