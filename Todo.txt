Todos:
- PixelType and ElementType should be treated appropriately in the ImportImageContainer related code (even though it currently works for scalar images)
- deal with vector, tensor and multi-channel images
- add CMake install rules
- allow distributing Cython-generated source files together with ITK code and a CMakeLists
- make Numpy an optional dependency
